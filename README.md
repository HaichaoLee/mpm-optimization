# mpm-optimiziation

Optimization-based implicit material point method using L-BFGS,
implemented from the [SIGGRAPH course notes](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~cffjiang/mpmcourse/mpm_course_nodes.pdf)
and [optimization paper](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/papers/GSSJT15.pdf).

# notes

- I coded up this project very quickly to test out some research ideas. It is not optimized or bug free.  
- Currently only Neohookean particles are implemented.
- There is no fancy renderer. I visualize the particles with [VDB](https://github.com/zdevito/vdb).

# dependencies

Included is a modified version of [CppOptimizationLibrary](https://github.com/PatWie/CppNumericalSolvers).  
Not included, but required for compilation, is [Eigen3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).
